abstract: Understanding dietary selection and feeding strategies is important for the conservation and management of endangered primate species. Here, we conducted a preliminary study on the diet and feeding behavior of endangered Shortridge’s langurs (Trachypithecus shortridgei) within the Drung River Valley (Dulongjiang) in southwestern China.

# Introduction
Dietary traits among and within primate species are shaped by both phylogenetic and environmental factors, as well as the nutritional and physical properties of foods [@lambert2010]. Environmental and climatic conditions can affect food availability and impact dietary diversity and composition [@hill2002]. An animal’s foraging strategy is an adaptive response to dietary constraints, such as food abundance, availability, and quality [@sundell2003]. The spatiotemporal distribution and abundance of food resources also influence foraging behavior in primates [@grueter2009;@hanya2013;@tsuji2013].
