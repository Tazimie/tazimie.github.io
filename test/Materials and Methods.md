# Materials and Methods
We recorded one of the following five categories of tree crown coverage: 0 = <1%, 1= 1-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3= 51-75%, and 4 = 76-100%  [@grueter2009;@hanya2013]. A relative food availability index ($W_i$) was used to describe food availability: 
$$
W_i = \frac{O_i}{P}
$$
where $O_i$ is the total scores of food availability of a given food type (young leaves, fruits etc.)
